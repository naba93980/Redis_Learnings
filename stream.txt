stream ->  series of events

each producer has unique identity and there can be many consumers reading from one single stream
consumers can further themselves be producers producing data in other streams

streams act as buffer between consumers and producers

redis streams are like append only log, an entry in redis stream is immutable, each entry has unique id, by default these entries are timestamps,
means redis streams keeps entries ordered as a time series

each entry in stream is lot more like redis hash, entries are schemaless

xadd key * field1 value1 field2 value2 -> add new data as set of name value pair in key stream
xrange key starttime endtime [count n] -> show all data entry in between the given time range, count n t limit the number of rentires returned
xrange key - + count n -> minus -> lowest time, plus -> highest time
xrevrange key latesttime oldesttime
xrevrange key + - count n -> minus -> lowest time, plus -> highest time
